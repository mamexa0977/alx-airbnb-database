# ALX Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Database Seed Script

It populates the database with example users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages to support **development, testing, and demonstration**.

## üìò Overview

The script inserts mock data to simulate a real-world Airbnb environment.  
It assumes that the database schema (from `schema.sql`) has already been created.
